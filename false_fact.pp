# You can never, it turns out, test a boolean fact with a bare "if". That's because they're actually strings, and while false is false, "false" is true.
# Interestingly, stdlib includes a function that can convert strings to booleans! So use that.
# if str2bool($is_virtual) {
#   notice("It's virtual!")
# }
# else {
#   notice("It's physical!")
