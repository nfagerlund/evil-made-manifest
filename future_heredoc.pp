This string should be able to interpolate variables, and all backslashes should
be interpreted as plain old literal backslashes.

# Identical results with 3.7.5 and 4.0.0.
# That is 100% a bug. Filed PUP-4462.
# Fixed in commit f5974e2863cd857625634959ce09deb0344fcfc4, after which we see this instead:
# Notice: Scope(Class[main]): This string should be able to interpolate variables, and all backslashes should

# Variable standing apart: hi there
# Variable enjambed: heyhi there
# Variable with single backslash enjambed: \hi there
# Variable with double backslash enjambed: \\hi there

# ...which is what I originally expected to see.
