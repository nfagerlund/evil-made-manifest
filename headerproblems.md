This document is so I can reverse-engineer github's header ID munging, which doesn't appear to be documented anywhere. It appears to happen as a post-processing step to the rendered HTML, since they use many different tools to render the various lightweight markups and the anchors have a consistency that should be impossible if you're relying on the upstream tools.

Observed behaviors:
-----

- This is an HTML post-processor that is invoked AFTER the markup renderer has run. This means it should act the same regardless of markup choice. It may act slightly different with embedded raw HTML in markdown, due to the way text nodes get cleaned up by the markdown renderer. (See spaces, etc.; discrepancies here are what proved it to be a post-processor.)
- It doesn't embed IDs in the header tag; it adds an `<a name="..." class="anchor" href="..."></a>` element inside the header. (Note the weird old "name" attribute.)
- Any `id="..."` element pre-existing in a header is removed.
- All HTML tags are deleted, but the text inside any HTML element will remain.
- All uppercase alphabetic ASCII chars are downcased.
    - Non-ascii alphabetic characters (inc. Cyrillic, accented Latin, and I don't know what else) will count as alphabetic characters (i.e. they won't be deleted or replaced with hyphens), but they will NOT be downcased -- things like Ñ and Á will remain as literals in the final ID.
        - Wondering what the criteria they're using for identifying alphabetic chars is; is it based on Unicode definitions?
        - This appears to match the behavior of Ruby's String#downcase method.
- All spaces are replaced with hyphens
    - Including multiple spaces in a row! They are not collapsed.
    - Hard tab characters (ascii 9) are replaced with FOUR hyphens (`----`). The markdown processor github is using passes hard tabs through unmolested, so they act the same as in embedded html fragments.
    - Leading and trailing spaces can be (and usually are) stripped by a given markup language's rendering library. If there are any spaces ANYWHERE in the resulting HTML, they are treated as normal spaces. This means trailing spaces in a literal `<h3>` will become hyphens.
- All hyphens are left alone
- All underscores are left alone
- All remaining non-alphanumeric chars are deleted (inc. periods)
    - HTML entities (`&amp;`) are treated as though they were the character they represent.
    - Things like `&nbsp;` are considered non-alphanumeric and non-space, and get deleted.
    - Again, it's detecting non-ASCII alphabetic characters and leaving them alone. It seems likely that they're using regex Unicode "character properties" (http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html#label-Character+Properties), which are not available in Ruby 1.8.7 but are available in Ruby 1.9+ and several other regex engines -- if you did something like .gsub(/[^\p{L}_-]/, ''), it'd kill all non-alphabetic non-underscore non-hyphen characters.
- Duplicate headers are given a suffix of `-\d+`, i.e. a hyphen and one or more numbers.
    - The count starts with 1 on the second instance of the duplicate header; that is, the first instance has an implicit number of 0, though it isn't appended.
    - Duplication seems to be tested AFTER any other transformations: if removal of non-alphanumeric chars etc. would reduce two different strings to identical IDs, they are considered identical.
    - The count can go into multiple digits, if you have more than 10 of the same header text.
- All-numeric headers are fine, and work as predicted by above behaviors. (This is a difference from Kramdown, which shits itself over them.)
- Headers with no alphanumeric characters, spaces, hyphens, or underscores will reduce to an empty ID (`name=""`), and clicking the link-to-here icon will take you to the top of the page, LOL.
    - Headers with a mix of allowed and disallowed alphanumeric chars work as predicted by above behaviors, inc. w/r/t dupes etc.
